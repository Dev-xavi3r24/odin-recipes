    <h2>Description of the Dish</h2>
    <p>Salads are a versatile and refreshing dish that can be enjoyed as a light meal or a side accompaniment. 
        They typically consist of a variety of fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and sometimes proteins like 
        chicken, tofu, or cheese. Salads can be customized to suit different tastes and dietary preferences, 
        making them a popular choice for health-conscious individuals. They are often dressed with vinaigrettes, 
        creamy dressings, or simple olive oil and lemon juice to enhance their flavors. Whether it's a classic 
        Caesar salad, a vibrant Greek salad, or a hearty Cobb salad, there's a salad for every occasion.</p>
